The ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem (RSEc) is a project that centralizes and curates high-quality metadata for computational biology software tools, providing a unified resource for researchers. By synchronizing metadata from various <a href="/partners">major software-related services</a>. The RSEc enables the discovery, validation, and cross-linking of software information. The repository is <a href="/licence">open</a>, version-controlled, and <a href="https://github.com/research-software-ecosystem">hosted on GitHub</a>, allowing researchers to explore software metadata and improve the consistency and quality of information across the computational biology landscape. This centralized approach facilitates better curation, interoperability, and the development of new services, ultimately enhancing the reliability and utility of research software.
